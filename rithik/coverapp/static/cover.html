            <p>Blockchain is a decentralized digital system that records information in a secure and transparent way. Instead of being stored in one central location, data on a blockchain is shared across many computers, making it difficult to alter or hack. Information is grouped into blocks, and each block is linked to the previous one using cryptography, creating a chain.</p>
